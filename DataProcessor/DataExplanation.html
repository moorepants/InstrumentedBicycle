<h2>Raw Data</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>ADOT</dt>
    <dd>Asynchornous Data Output Type. This tells you what the asynchronous
    output is of the VectorNav. Right now it can either be 14 or 253. 14 is the
    filtered data and 253 is the unfiltered. Refer to the VN-100
    documentation.</dd>

    <dt>Rider</dt>
    <dd>This gives the first name of the person riding the bicycle or 'None' if
    noone is on the bicycle while the data was taken.</dd>

    <dt>Bicycle</dt>
    <dd>
    The gives the bicycle configuration.
    <ul>
        <li>Rigid Rider: The instrumented bicycle with the rigid body
        cast.</li></ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>Maneuver</dt>
    <dd>
        The particular maneuver being performed.
        <ul>
            <li>System Test: This is a generic label for data collected during
            various system tests.</li>
            <li>Balance: The rider is instructed to simply balance the bicycle
            and keep a relatively straight heading. The rider should look into
            the distance and not focus on any close objects.</li>
            <li>Balance With Disturbance: Same as 'Balance' except that a
            lateral force disturbance is applied to the seat of the
            bicycle.</li>
            <li>Tracking Straight Line: The rider is instructed to focus on a
            straight line that is on the ground and attempt to keep the edge of
            the front wheel aligned with the line. The line of site from the
            rider's eyes to the the line on the ground should be tangent to the
            front of the front wheel.</li>
            <li>Tracking Straight Line With Disturbance: Same as "Tracking
            Straight Line" except that a lateral perturbation force is applied
            to the seat of the bicycle.</li>
            <li>Lane Change: The rider is instructed to perform a lane change
            trying to keep the bicycle on a line on the ground. For the
            Pavillion Floor, the line is taped on the ground and the rider is
            instructed to do whatever feels best to stay on the line. They can
            use full preview looking ahead, focus on the front wheel and line,
            or a combination of both.</li>
        </ul>

    <dt>NINumSamples, integer</dt>
    <dd>The number of samples taken during the run on the NI USB-6218</dt>

    <dt>VNavNumSamples, integer</dt>
    <dd>The number of samples taken for the run on the VN-100</dt>

    <dt>RunID, integer</dt>
    <dd>The unique five digit number for the run</dt>

    <dt>NISampleRate, integer</dt>
    <dd>The sample rate in hertz of the NI USB-6218</dt>

    <dt>VNavSampleRate, integer</dt>
    <dd>The sample rate in hertz of the NI USB-6218</dt>

    <dt>ReferenceFrameRotation</dt>
    <dd>The output of the VectorNav showing the rotation matrix for the
    device.</dd>

    <dt>Speed, float</dt>
    <dd>The desired speed of the bicycle. This is slighty redundant, the rear
    wheel speed motor voltage should be used for the actual speed.</dd>

    <dt>Environment, string</dt>
    <dd>This is the location, building and/or equipment where the data was
    taken. Options include: Pavilion Floor, Laboratory, Hull Treadmill</dd>

    <dt>Duration, float</dt>
    <dd>The duration of the run in seconds.</dd>

    <dt>VNavComPort, string</dt>
    <dd>The Windows communications port that the VN-100 is connected to. The is
    typically COM3 but could be others.</dd>

    <dt>Wait, float</dt>
    <dd>This is the time in seconds that the software waits for the rider to press the
    collect data trigger. If the rider doesn't push the button before this
    time, the software crashes.</dd>

    <dt>Baudrate, integer</dt>
    <dd>This is the baud rate at which the VN-100 is connected at.</dd>

    <dt>ModelNumber, string</dt>
    <dd>This is the raw string from the VN-100 displaying the device's model
    number.</dd>
